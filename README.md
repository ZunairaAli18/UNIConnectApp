Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the running tests section for more information.

npm run build

Builds the app for production and outputs it to the build folder.

Bundles React in production mode.

Optimizes the build for the best performance.

Minifies the code and includes hashed filenames.

Your app will be ready for deployment.

For more information, see the deployment guide.

npm run eject

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back.

This command removes the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project, allowing full control over them. Use this option if you need to customize your setup beyond the default configuration.

All other scripts will still work after ejecting, but they will refer to the copied files.
